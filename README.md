### Features

* A powerful extension of the Large Multi-modal Model for generic (panoptic, instance, semantic) segmentation, referring segmentation and interactivate segmentation.
* Support joint training across multiple segmentation tasks and visual-language tasks.
* Demonstrates zero-shot capabilities on unseen task, such as open-vocabulary segmentation, generalizaed referring segmentation, and video object segmentation.
